During registration, you must enter the data correctly and fill in all fields.

Also, you should pay attention to the email you enter. It must be correct and existing.

The user window in FinYsis allows you to add a purchase to the database. 
You must enter the name of the purchase, the cost, and also select the type of purchase.

FinYsis tracks and immediately shows the number of purchases made from your account (My purcases).

If everything went well, your purchase will be written to the database, and you will see a corresponding message about the correct operation of the application.
Also, the number of your purchases displayed in the application will increase by one.
